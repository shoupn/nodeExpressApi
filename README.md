# NodeJs/Express/MongoDB RestAPI example

This is a sample REST api that includes the established norms for a rest API. I have not worked with node before but recently took Jon Mill's Course on pluralsight and created the example API from following along. For a full description of what a REST API should include, please checkout my post https://fundamentalsofcode.com/restful-web-services/ on what a RESTful webservice ought to offer. 

## Getting Started

You should be able to clone this repository and run `npm init` and have a working API after changing the mongoDb connection strings. I am using mLab for this example as I did not feel like installing mongoDb on my system. To run then in the console run `gulp`

### Prerequisites

You'll need node package manager and node installed on your machine. Running `npm install` should install all dependencies. 

## Running the tests

Run `gulp test`.
